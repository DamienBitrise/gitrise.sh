### Release Notes


* Changed the way logs were fetched from Bitrise. Instead of streaming, build logs are now pulled after the build is completed. 

* Improved the code qulity by adding error handling mechanisms and a lot more unit tests.

* Switched from Travis CI to Github Actions to run CI/CD pipelines. Releases are now done automatically using the CD pipeline.
